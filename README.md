# Gipher-Project
This project is a web app that uses the Giphy API. It can be used for searching for gifs by topic, to add to favourites/delete from favourites, and to find recommendations based on the user's favourites.
In order to add to favourites or find recommendations, the user has to be logged in.
Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Typescript, along with a few added features like Angular Material and Toastr, the front end of this web app was developed.
The backend uses C#/.NET, Entity Framework, RESTful APIs, and Microservice architecture.
The databases used are MSSQL and MongoDB using polyglot persistence.
